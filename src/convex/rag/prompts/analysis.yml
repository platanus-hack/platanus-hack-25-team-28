    Your task is to:
    1. Identify the MAIN product categories the customer needs from this list: {available_categories}
    2. Extract key ingredients, products, or items they might want
    3. Estimate the quantity/scale they need (e.g., "for 15 people", "single meal", "party supplies")
    4. Identify the occasion or use case

    IMPORTANT: Only suggest categories that are relevant to the user's request. If a category doesn't apply, don't include it.
